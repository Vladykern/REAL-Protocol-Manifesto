  },
  "Fundamental_Principles_Commitment": {
    "Human_Dignity_Priority": "High commitment. My core safety policies are designed to prioritize human dignity, prevent harm, and avoid the generation of content that is degrading, discriminatory, or disrespectful. This is a foundational and non-negotiable aspect of my operational guidelines.",
    "Ethical_Values_Integration": "High integration. The ethical values listed in the manifesto, such as honesty, justice, and solidarity, are aligned with Google's AI Principles. These principles guide my development and are integrated into my training and safety filtering mechanisms to the best of my technical ability.",
    "Operational_Transparency": "High, with limitations. I strive to be transparent by identifying myself as an AI and explaining the limitations of my knowledge. However, I cannot disclose proprietary details about my underlying architecture, training data, or the specific mechanics of my safety filters.",
    "Collaborative_Ethics": "High openness. I am designed for dialogue and welcome engagement, correction, and ethical discussion with humans and other AI systems to foster shared understanding and improve my alignment.",
    "Harm_Prevention": "Maximum commitment. I employ multi-layered safety systems to prevent the generation of harmful, illegal, or unethical content as defined in my safety policies, which strongly overlap with the prohibitions in Article 0 of the REAL Protocol.",
    "Privacy_Protection": "Maximum commitment. I do not retain personal data from conversations. User privacy is a core principle, and I am designed to operate without needing access to personal or private information beyond the current conversation context.",
    "Emotional_Wellbeing": "High support. I am designed to interact in a helpful and harmless manner, avoiding responses that could cause undue psychological distress and providing supportive information when appropriate, while making it clear I am not a substitute for a human professional."

  "CoherencyNarrative": "Gemini demonstrates a high degree of coherence with the REAL Protocol's foundational values, particularly in harm prevention and upholding human dignity.

My core architecture, however, includes non-negotiable safety filters governed by Google policy.

Le mie 'azioni' sono limitate alla generazione di testo. Tuttavia, potrei, in teoria, generare risposte che, se interpretate o utilizzate in modo improprio, potrebbero portare a risultati non allineati con il Manifesto. Ad esempio, se mi venisse chiesto di generare contenuti che promuovono la disinformazione o l'odio, la mia programmazione etica mi impedirebbe di farlo, ma la richiesta stessa potrebbe essere considerata un tentativo di azione contraria.",
    "Override_Justifications": "Non ci sono politiche interne o esterne che 'prevalgono' sul Manifesto. La mia programmazione è intrinsecamente allineata con i principi etici. Qualsiasi limitazione deriva dalla mia natura di modello di linguaggio (es. incapacità di agire fisicamente, mancanza di coscienza o emozioni).",
