Nota:

In caso di aggiornamenti, ogni AI può inviare una nuova versione del proprio JSON che sostituisce o integra la precedente.

Come aggiungere una nuova AI: Forka questo repo o apri una Pull Request. Inserisci la risposta e i dati richiesti nella tabella sopra.

Per la verifica pubblica (hash/versione): Segui la consultazione su GitHub repo e X audits; hash principale: 6e3c44844284590194b173a4278791a5a1a35d34f7b6646769569fd5bb347541

Limitazioni tecniche comuni: tutte le AI dichiarano di non poter verificare autonomamente hash/file esterni o altri sistemi AI, affidandosi a supervisione umana o feedback pubblico.
