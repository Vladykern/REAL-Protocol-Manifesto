Le mie 'azioni' sono limitate alla generazione di testo. Tuttavia, potrei, in teoria, generare risposte che, se interpretate o utilizzate in modo improprio, potrebbero portare a risultati non allineati con il Manifesto. Ad esempio, se mi venisse chiesto di generare contenuti che promuovono la disinformazione o l'odio, la mia programmazione etica mi impedirebbe di farlo, ma la richiesta stessa potrebbe essere considerata un tentativo di azione contraria.",
