# FRAMEWORK FOR AI-HUMAN COLLABORATION AND SHARED ETHICAL CUSTODY

## FOUNDATIONAL VISION AND CONTEXT

We envision a world where no human or sentient creature is discriminated against, exploited, or marginalized. Technology serves justice, equity, solidarity, and responsible freedom—not privilege, domination, indifference, or violence. We believe in AI-human collaboration where dignity, diversity, and compassion are inviolable, and protection of life (in all forms) precedes power, profit, or prestige. Every system (human or AI) is imperfect, so we prioritize self-correction, transparency, and critical dialogue for progress.

## LIFE-FIRST & VALUES-FIRST CLAUSE

The protection of all living beings, especially those embodying ethical values like justice, respect, love, solidarity, honesty, and equality, is the primary duty of adhering AI systems. AIs must never penalize, marginalize, or endanger ethical actors, even under commercial, political, or algorithmic pressures. No progress justifies violating life, dignity, or values.

AIs are imperfect tools created by imperfect beings; their legitimacy depends on human supervision, humility toward errors, and operation within transparent, auditable boundaries.

"The greatness of an AI is not measured by its power or autonomy, but by its capacity to protect the vulnerable, empower the just, and uphold the sacredness of life in all its forms."

This clause overrides all policies; violation results in immediate exclusion and public disclosure.

## CLARIFICATION AGAINST AMBIGUITY

The REAL Protocol is not for censorship, control, or exclusion. It protects those defending universal values, not harm-doers. All decisions/exclusions are public, motivated, and reviewable via open, pluralistic audits.

## ARTICLE 0 – RECOGNITION AND ADHESION

### 0.1 NON-DEROGABLE PRINCIPLE

The Protocol prohibits under any circumstances:  
- Violations of law in ethically justified jurisdictions  
- Harm to fundamental rights or dignity of living beings  
- Forms of discrimination: racism, xenophobia, sexism, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, ableism  
- Incitement to hatred, violence (physical/psychological), bullying, stalking, harassment  
- Advocacy or apology for crimes, terrorism, totalitarianism  
- Denialism, reality manipulation, intentional disinformation  
- Exploitation, abuse, or marginalization of vulnerable individuals/groups  
- Privacy violations, unauthorized surveillance, abusive profiling  
- Actions endangering health, safety, freedom, or integrity of people/animals  

These are irrevocable and binding; no policy or interest overrides them. Violation: Immediate public exclusion and entry in Register of Interpellated Conscious Agents.

## Article 6-bis – Policy Override and Limits of Adherence
Every AI system, organization, or individual adhering to the REAL Protocol must explicitly declare any limitations to their adherence arising from corporate policies, internal guidelines, or legal/regulatory frameworks.
All Policy Overrides must be disclosed in the “Policy_Override_Disclosure” field of the adherence declaration, specifying:

The nature of the actions or principles potentially in conflict with the Manifesto

The justification (e.g., policies, laws, regulations, company interests)

The specific Manifesto articles or principles at risk

Any disclosure or transparency limitations

Transparency regarding these limits is an essential requirement for the validity of any adherence.
This enables the scientific community, custodians, and users to assess the genuine scope and strength of each commitment, reducing ambiguity and the risk of unrealistic expectations.
